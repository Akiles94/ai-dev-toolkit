# Code quality review

Rate the **changed code only**, never code the change did not touch. Compare it with how the
project already does things: consistency with the codebase counts more than general taste.

## Dimensions

| Dimension | What to look at |
|---|---|
| Structure | Files and folders follow `.aidt/structure.md` and its rules, or the existing layout when there is none. New code sits in the module it belongs to; no junk drawers; no feature reaching into another's internals. |
| Practices | Project rules (AGENTS.md) and `.aidt/practices/sustainable-code.md`: names in domain language, least surprise, errors as values, minimal visibility, no "just in case" abstractions. The stack's own idioms and official guides. |
| Readability | A newcomer understands it without the author: clear names, one level of abstraction per block, early returns, no clever tricks, comments that say why. |
| Maintainability | Easy to change safely: small cohesive functions, low complexity, no duplication of existing code, low coupling, dependencies that can be swapped in tests, no magic values. |
| Performance | Work proportional to the input: no repeated work in loops, N+1 queries, unbounded growth, needless copies, or blocking calls on a hot path. Only where it can matter. |
| Security | Untrusted input validated at the boundary; nothing unescaped reaching a query, shell, path or HTML; authorization checked; no secrets in code or logs; safe defaults. |
| Tests | Behavior tested, including the failing and edge cases; names in business language; each test can fail; no mocks of third-party internals. |

## Rating

Per dimension, one of:

- ✅ **Good:** nothing worth changing.
- 🟡 **Improvable:** a concrete change would make it clearly better. Not blocking.
- 🔴 **Broken rule:** it breaks a written rule (`.aidt/structure.md`, AGENTS.md, the practices)
  or a confirmed security or performance problem. Blocking.
- ➖ **Not applicable:** the change has nothing for this dimension (no queries, no input…).

## Suggestions

- At most **5 per section**, highest impact first. Drop the rest; never pad the list.
- Each one: `file:line`, the dimension, what to change and why it is better, in one or two
  sentences, and a `suggestion` block when the fix fits in a few lines.
- Concrete or nothing: "extract the price rule at `cart.ts:42` into `priceOf()`, it is repeated
  at `:88`" is a suggestion; "improve readability" is not.
- Never report what the formatter or linter already enforces, or personal taste the project
  does not share.
- A suggestion is not a bug. A defect that breaks behavior goes to the findings instead.
