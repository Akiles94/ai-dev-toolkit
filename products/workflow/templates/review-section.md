<!--
  Template: review/sNN-<slug>.md · written by the reviewer · one per section, used as the PR description.
  Audience: a developer who has not seen the spec, plan or conversation. Write for them.
  Rules for the agent:
  - Plain language, short sentences. Define any technical term in one line the first time.
  - Every claim points to `file:line`. Never describe code you have not read.
  - "Walkthrough" uses one realistic input and follows it step by step with real values.
  - Numbers in "At a glance" come from `aidt diff --json`, never estimated.
  - Warnings: 🔴 breaks a requirement or is a real risk · 🟡 worth a look · ℹ️ not requested.
  - Keep every block. Write "None" when a block has nothing to say. Customize the set of blocks
    by editing this template; the reviewer follows whatever blocks it contains.
  Delete these comments when filling the template.
